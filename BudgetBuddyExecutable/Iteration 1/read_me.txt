To run the Budget Buddy Application go to BudgetBuddyExecutable/Iteration 1/CS6920Group4Project.exe and double click to run.

IF you encounter a MySql.Data Missing assembly exeception you need to download the MySql.Data.dll file that is in the 
  BudgetBuddyExecutable/Iteration 1/ directory and put it in the directory where the CS6920Group4Project.exe resides.

We encountered this issue on a computer that does not have MySql C# Connector or MySql installed, and this is a temporary fix for Iteration 1.
